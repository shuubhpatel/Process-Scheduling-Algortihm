# Process-Scheduling-Algortihm

Our Project is based on Process Scheduling Algorithms. Here are a set of instructions on how can you use it. 
· Our project doesn’t require any third-party software to run frontend or backend installation. 
· This project is platform-independent because HTML runs in the browser and it is an interpreted language. 
· To run this project, one has to extract the file and click on index.html and it will in any browser designated by your computer. 
· Where you can find our homepage where you can find information about CPU scheduling algorithms. 
· Below that you can find CPU scheduler where various algorithms are there you can select any algorithm and add or delete process, after adding processes you can edit burst time of each and every process by clicking + - signs.
· After setting burst time you can run the scheduler and this will show Gantt chart, timeline chart and a final table consisting of arrival time, total burst time, completion time, turn around time, waiting time and response time.
· Below that you can find each and every information about every scheduling algorithms with graphical representation.
· According to us we can change the styling of this project and make this more attractive also we can add other topics related to process scheduling. 
· Here we can also add more content in graphical representation so that we can make this very interesting and easy to learn for users.
